                    What Are Powder Brows?
                </p>
                <p>

                    <b>Powder brows</b> (also known as powder brow tattoo or shaded brows) is a semi-permanent make-up
                    procedure
                    for eyebrow enhancement in which the artist inserts PMU pigments into the top layers of the skin
                    with a
                    tattoo machine designed using the dotting technique, or pixelization.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a result, a powdery eyebrow effect is achieved, and misty, powdered brows are created. The
                    technique
                    is similar to microshading, but the results are more dramatic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole powder brows procedure resembles the procedure of microblading, but the technique used is
                    different, and so is the final outcome.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole procedure is a two-step process, and it consists of the initial insertion of the pigment
                    and
                    the touch-up that takes place 6 – 8 weeks after the initial procedure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Powder brows create the desired fullness of your eyebrows in a bespoke arch shape that best suits
                    your
                    facial features and brings out your natural beauty.

                    <b>Powder Eyebrow</b> is recommended for those clients who wear make-up every day and are the
                    perfect finishing
                    touch to every make-up look.

                    What Are Aquarelle Lips?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aquarelle lips are a form of lip blushing that blends the colour of your choice into the lips in
                    a
                    soft airbrushed effect similar to a lip tint. It doesn’t define the edges of the lips as much as
                    other techniques do. In fact, that’s what differentiates aquarelle lips from regular lip
                    blushing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aquarelle lip blush doesn’t outline the lips into a defined shape, but rather gives the
                    illusion
                    of wearing no makeup, like your lips are naturally that colour. This is achieved by a shaded,
                    blended edge that’s less saturated in colour than the centre of the lips. The inspiration behind
                    this lip-blushing pattern are watercolour paintings, so authentic aquarelle lips give a blended,
                    soft effect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The look of aquarelle lips is very subtle and it’s appropriate for every occasion, from everyday
                    activities to special events.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As with any semi-permanent lip tattoo, the aquarelle lips are done by opening up the skin with
                    an
                    electric needle device and depositing colour into it. So it’s technically a form of tattooing,
                    but
                    it doesn’t last forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aquarelle lip tattoo uses PMU pigments rather than ink which are formulated in such a way
                    that
                    the body can break them down, and the colour fades until it becomes invisible. This is a gradual
                    process, so you can get up to 3 years of enhanced lips from an aquarelle lip tattoo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The results can be prolonged by getting a colour boost and replenishing the pigments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aquarelle lips technique implies a soft blending of colour into the lips, so the colour is
                    built
                    up in several passes to achieve the blurred, airbrushed effect.
