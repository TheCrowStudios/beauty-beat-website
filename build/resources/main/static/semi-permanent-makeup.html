                    What Are Powder Brows?
                </h1>
                <p>

                    <b>Powder brows</b> (also known as powder brow tattoo or shaded brows) is a semi-permanent make-up
                    procedure
                    for eyebrow enhancement in which the artist inserts PMU pigments into the top layers of the skin
                    with a
                    tattoo machine designed using the dotting technique, or pixelization.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a result, a powdery eyebrow effect is achieved, and misty, powdered brows are created. The
                    technique
                    is similar to microshading, but the results are more dramatic.

                    <br>
                    The whole powder brows procedure resembles the procedure of microblading, but the technique used is
                    different, and so is the final outcome.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole procedure is a two-step process, and it consists of the initial insertion of the pigment
                    and
                    the touch-up that takes place 6 â€“ 8 weeks after the initial procedure.

                    <br>
                    Powder brows create the desired fullness of your eyebrows in a bespoke arch shape that best suits
                    your
                    facial features and brings out your natural beauty.

                    <b>Powder Eyebrow</b> is recommended for those clients who wear make-up every day and are the
                    perfect finishing
                    touch to every make-up look.
