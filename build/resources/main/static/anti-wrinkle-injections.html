                    <br>
                    Lines and wrinkles develop with the passage of time. Wrinkles caused by facial expressions can
                    appear around the eyes, between the brow, and on the forehead. These wrinkles can cause concern and
                    often give an aged or tired appearance. Anti-wrinkle injections can have remarkable results in
                    improving the appearance of the skin and also enhance feelings of health and wellbeing. We can also
                    treat lower face muscles to make subtle changes to the appearance of the lip, chin, and jawline.

                    What Are Aquarelle Lips?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aquarelle lips are a form of lip blushing that blends the colour of your choice into the lips in
                    a
                    soft airbrushed effect similar to a lip tint. It doesn’t define the edges of the lips as much as
                    other techniques do. In fact, that’s what differentiates aquarelle lips from regular lip
                    blushing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aquarelle lip blush doesn’t outline the lips into a defined shape, but rather gives the
                    illusion
                    of wearing no makeup, like your lips are naturally that colour. This is achieved by a shaded,
                    blended edge that’s less saturated in colour than the centre of the lips. The inspiration behind
                    this lip-blushing pattern are watercolour paintings, so authentic aquarelle lips give a blended,
                    soft effect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The look of aquarelle lips is very subtle and it’s appropriate for every occasion, from everyday
                    activities to special events.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As with any semi-permanent lip tattoo, the aquarelle lips are done by opening up the skin with
                    an
                    electric needle device and depositing colour into it. So it’s technically a form of tattooing,
                    but
                    it doesn’t last forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aquarelle lip tattoo uses PMU pigments rather than ink which are formulated in such a way
                    that
                    the body can break them down, and the colour fades until it becomes invisible. This is a gradual
                    process, so you can get up to 3 years of enhanced lips from an aquarelle lip tattoo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The results can be prolonged by getting a colour boost and replenishing the pigments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aquarelle lips technique implies a soft blending of colour into the lips, so the colour is
                    built
                    up in several passes to achieve the blurred, airbrushed effect.
